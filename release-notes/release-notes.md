# Stable Releases

## 8.3.3 (07/27/2021)

### FIXED

* Fixed some minor bugs about scanning.

## 8.3 (07/19/2021)

### NEW

* Added support for .NET Core 3.1 and .NET 5.

### FIXED

* Fixed the bug that the Scanner UI will close automatically after 2 minutes if nothing is done.

* Fixed some other minor bugs.

## 8.1.2 (02/20/2020)

### NEW

* Added a new property `extendedImageInfoQueryLevel` for the method `AcquireImage` that allows setting up how the library queries extended image info items. In version 8.1, the default level would result in scanning failure or serious performance issues with some scanners.

### FIXED

* Fixed the handle leak issue of OCR.

* Fixed the bug that the extended image info messages are not returned when setting `IfGetExtendedImageInfo` to true.

* Fixed the bug that mouse scroll moving up only.
